	// Place your snippets for python here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "pyall",
		"body": [
""
""
""
""
"def solution(T):"
"	n=int(input())"
""
""
"TT=1"
"# TT=int(input())"
"for T in range(1,TT+1):"
"	solution(T)"
		],
		"description": "Log output to console"
	}
}
